        "description": "Sprout is a social gardening application to promote bee-friendly and native-plant gardens across the Greater Vancouver area. Using the application, the Sprout team hoped to inspire users to connect with their community and learn more about the ecosystem around them. <br/><br/>As a Full-Stack Developer, some of my most notable contributions to the project includes the implementation of both the back and front-end of a user's sprout profiles (each individual plant's record), plant database search, plant database results, alerts, and leaderboard. Plant data collected was provided with courtesy from <a href='https://plantdatabase.kpu.ca/'>Kwantlen Polytechnic University's School of Horticulture (2015)</a>. <br/><br/>üèÜ Sprout is awarded <a href='https://commons.bcit.ca/news/2021/06/creating-a-sustainability-app-so-much-more-than-writing-code/'> Best Design in BCIT CST program's Projects II </a> for the term of Fall/Winter 2021 out of 51 total projects.",
