The project came from a place of shared advocacy for mental health and from my experience being a Crisis Line volunteer. For this project experience, I learned a lot about front-end UI/UX programming using the little tools and knowledge I've picked up and about consolidating CSS stylsheets for shared components across pages.<br/><br/>Our team had a lot of ideas for this project, but only so much time to complete it. A lot of these features that we would have loved to include are in the Project Potential tab below. In some ways, this was also the first time I had to consider prioritizing and limiting the scope of a project.",
